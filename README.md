# Example analysis: characterization of deletions and duplications #

## Coding sample for bioinformatics portfolio ##

Problem: The team is developing an NGS-based assay for a recently characterized autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the “CNSL” gene. Deletions and duplications in this region are common, the deletion/duplication breakpoints can vary from sample to sample, and it has been hypothesized that the breakpoints correspond with ethnicity, and the possible breakpoints are known from literature. The goal is to characterize these CNV breakpoints.
